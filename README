udev-based automounter (uam)

== INTRO

What is it all about? This is just simple tool for mounting pendrives and alikes
when inserted -- something like ivman or functionality integrated in KDE/GNOME.

So what's the difference? Unlike those tools uam doesn't use HAL. Unlike
traditional automounters it doesn't require you to sacrifice memory for three
additional daemons -- HAL, dbus & the mounter itself. Instead you just have to
have udev running (which you'd like to have anyway) and uam will be called by it
everytime an USB stick is inserted.

It has few drawbacks too. The most important that it can't mount ejectable
drives -- it fully depends on udev, which doesn't report anything when CD or
floppy is inserted.

Currently there is also no mechanism for allowing non-root users to umount
uam-mounted drives. They can either 'sync' the device and hope everything will
be fine when they remove the disk (uam will unmount it then) or use pmount.


== INSTALLING

If you're using Gentoo, you'd probably like to use ebuild from my overlay:
# layman -o http://svn.mgorny.alt.pl/emdzientoo/trunk/layman.xml -a emdzientoo
# emerge uam

Else, you can install it manually:
$ make
# make install
...and you're done. The scripts will be installed in /lib/udev/uam/, config file
will be located in /etc/udev and rules file in /etc/udev/rules.d/.

You'd probably like to reload udev rules, too:
# udevadm control --reload-rules


== USING

It should 'just work'. If it doesn't, take a look at syslog and/or configuration
file. If you're sure everything is set right, contact me and I'll see what I can
do for you.
