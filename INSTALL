uam -- short installation guide
-------------------------------


Gentoo Linux installation guide
===============================

As of 2010-10-01, an ebuild for uam is available in the gentoo-x86
repository (aka the portage tree). Thus, it can be installed using any
Package Manager without adding any additional repositories:

	# emerge sys-apps/uam


Manual release installation guide
=================================

If your distribution vendor didn't supply uam in a package, you can
install it manually using the Makefile distributed in the package.

Please note that uam is a specific package and it's unnecessary to
call the `./configure` script by default. Especially that it requires
`fastconf` to be installed.

To install uam to your root filesystem, call:

	$ make
	# make install

Please note that it is preferred to avoid writing to the live
filesystem, and you should indeed use a fake root instead:

	$ make DESTDIR=/your-fake-root-path install

And then transfer the files from the fake root into your actual
filesystem or build a package containing them.


Manual HEAD installation guide
==============================

If you prefer to use git HEAD instead, you need to grab and install
fastconf [1] first. Afterwards, call the `./configure` script to
generate the Makefile:

	$ ./configure
